<p><b>Personal individualization.</b> Here at ShakeBot, we appreciate that no two individuals are identical and therefore may require different exercise-related nutrition strategies to optimize their energy levels, body compositions, exercise recoveries, and ultimately, their athletic performances. Whether you are an athlete trying to improve your athletic performance, an exercise enthusiast who simply wants to maintain a healthy lifestyle, a weekend warrior who wants to dominate the competition, or just the Average Jane or Joe who wants to feel and look your best, ShakeBot can help you reach your goals. ShakeBot analyzes your unique personal qualities, such as your weight, preferred physical activities, and activity durations, to instantly customize your own exercise-related nutrition recommendations.</p>

ShakeBot evaluates the differences among your physical activities to determine the perfect ShakeBot product for your unique athletic situation.</p>
